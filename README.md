# Gotlib Cli 


Have you also always wanted to be able to borrow your books through the terminal? 
**Gotlib Cli** makes this possible and is the result of me wanting to play around with the web scraping tool [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer). 
Built in Node.js and Typescript.
