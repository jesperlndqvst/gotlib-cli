# Gotlib Cli

Have you also always wanted to be able to borrow your books through the terminal?
**Gotlib Cli** makes this possible and is the result of me wanting to play around with the web scraping tool [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer).
Built in Node.js and Typescript.

## About This Project

- Log in to your library account through the terminal.
- Search for books and borrow.
- Manage your account and cancel reservations you do not want.

## How To Use It

- 1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/jesperlndqvst/gotlib-cli` in your chosen terminal.
- 2. Enter the project folder using the command `cd gotlib-cli`.
- 3. Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and enter your library log in credentials that you use when you log in to [Gotlib](https://encore.gotlib.goteborg.se/) according to the `.env-template`.
- 4. Install the dependencies and run the project by using the command `npm install && npm start`.
